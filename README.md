# Credit-Risk-Modelling

The purpose of this is to compara Logistics and Random Forest prefermance in Credit Score Modelling.

## 1. DataVisualization.ipynb
This helps to understand the data -Region, income, interest rate...e.t.c How they affect predict variable.

## 2. PreProcessing&LogisticsRegression.ipynb
This responsible for data preprocessing and applying logistics Regression to build a score card.

## 3. Model 2 - RandomForest1.ipynb
This responsible for the 2nd model - RandomForest, using random forest to outputfeature importances and reduce random noise.

## Present.odp
A summary/ presentation of above.
